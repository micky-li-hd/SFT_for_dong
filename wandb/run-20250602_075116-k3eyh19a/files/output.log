Using a slow image processor as `use_fast` is unset and a slow processor was saved with this model. `use_fast=True` will be the default behavior in v4.52, even if the model was saved with a slow processor. This will result in minor differences in outputs. You'll still be able to use a slow processor with `use_fast=False`.
You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.llama.tokenization_llama_fast.LlamaTokenizerFast'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565 - if you loaded a llama tokenizer from a GGUF file you can ignore this message.
